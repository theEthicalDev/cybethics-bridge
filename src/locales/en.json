      "question": "How do you determine the cost of a project?",
      "answer": "Project costs are determined based on several factors: project scope and complexity, timeline requirements, technologies involved, and the level of ongoing support needed. We provide transparent pricing with no hidden fees and can work with fixed-price or time-and-materials models depending on your needs."
    },
    "timeline": {
      "question": "How long does it typically take to complete a software project?",
      "answer": "Project timelines vary significantly depending on scope and complexity. Small to medium projects might take 2-4 months, while larger enterprise solutions can take 6-12 months or more. We provide realistic timeline estimates during the planning phase and keep you updated on progress throughout development."

    },
    "ownership": {
      "question": "Who owns the intellectual property rights to the developed software?",
      "answer": "Upon final payment, you retain full ownership of all intellectual property rights to the custom software we develop for you. This includes source code, design elements, and documentation. We believe that if you pay for custom development, you should own the results completely."
    },
    "communication": {
      "question": "How do you handle project communication and updates?",
      "answer": "We maintain regular communication throughout the project using your preferred channels (email, phone, video calls, project management tools).
